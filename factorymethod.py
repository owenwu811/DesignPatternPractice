#Implement the Factory Method design pattern.

#The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

#You are given code that includes a few vehicles types and their respective factories. Complete the factory method implementation such that each factory returns the correct vehicle.

#Example:

#VehicleFactory carFactory = new CarFactory();
#VehicleFactory truckFactory = new TruckFactory();
#VehicleFactory bikeFactory = new BikeFactory();

#Vehicle myCar = carFactory.createVehicle();
#Vehicle myTruck = truckFactory.createVehicle();
#Vehicle myBike = bikeFactory.createVehicle();

#myCar.getType();   // "Car"
#myTruck.getType(); // "Truck"
#myBike.getType();  // "Bike"


#correct python3 solution (could not solve):

class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def getType(self) -> str:
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def getType(self) -> str:
        return "Car"

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def getType(self) -> str:
        return "Bike"

class Truck(Vehicle):
    def getType(self) -> str:
        return "Truck"

class VehicleFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def createVehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        pass

class CarFactory(VehicleFactory):
    # Write your code here
    def createVehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        return Car()

class BikeFactory(VehicleFactory):
    # Write your code here
    def createVehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        return Bike()

class TruckFactory(VehicleFactory):
    # Write your code here
    def createVehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        return Truck()
